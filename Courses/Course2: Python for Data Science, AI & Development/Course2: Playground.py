# All steps in order + bonus commands
#1) Import a file, if working locally you need a path i.e. look above
#2) file.name = returns the name of the file, file.mode = returns the mode e.g. r or w, file.read() = reads raw text, print(x) where x is a variable to which the file is assigned = returns formatted text, type(x) = returns string or something, file.close() = you guessed it, file.closed = verifies if file closed
#3) read first 4 characters (including spaces)
 with open("file.txt", "r") as File:
     print(File.read(4)) 
#4) read multiple amounts of characters:
with open(example1, "r") as file1:

#5) if you want to read one line at a time (if your text file has multiple \n lines) do:
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.readline())
#6) readline allows us to specify how many characters we wanna read, but it can only read one line, so if line 1 has 20 characters and we want to read 5000, it'll only print off the 20 that are in the line:
print(file1.readline(20)) # does not read past the end of line
print(file1.read(20)) # Returns the next 20 chars
#7) using a loop to iterate through the lines:
